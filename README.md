## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### What I learned

In this project I practiced developing the app, with React.js and Tailwind.css

Beside using hooks and passing props to components, main things I learned are:

- Creating simple dark mode for the app.
- I managed to create to arrays of todos, which are updated in sync, so the data is properly displayed,
  in the UI.
- Used multiple filter functions, with different constrains.
- Integrated local storage options for theme changing and storing todo list between sessions, for optimal
  user experience.

### What I want to explore

1. In my opinion, my app can be developed in much better way, some things do not feel quite optimized at the moment,
   also after testing app seems little bit slow.
2. I want to explore drag and drop kits for react.
